2. Filter by days
3. Location/Map
4. Photo on right side so if it's missing (e.g. Freewheel shop rides), it doesn't look weird
5. Clear cards for each group
6. Filter by group name
7. Capitlize Facebook, Instagram... nah
8. For annual events, have submittal button for events/link to same "submit an update" form.
9. Styling (MUI, Bootstrap, Tailwind)
10. Use offical Instagram and Facebook icons
11. Make locations links to Google Maps
12. Accessibility considerations
13. keep track of dates for events (e.g. TC3 group ride in Oct 2024)
14. event calendar? (or filtering by days and checking in with each group/making contact with each/requesting that they send updated ride info/review their info on the site and let us know with new changes)
